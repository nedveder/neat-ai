# Opening prompt

We are about to check the coding style of the project.
We will check function by function and file by file.
For every function we will check the following:
1. Function naming: Functions should be named using a lowercase, with words separated by underscores.

2. Function arguments: Function arguments should be named the same way as variables, using lowercase letters and words separated by underscores.

3. Docstrings: Functions should have a docstring that describes what the function does.

4. Indentation: Code inside the function should be indented by exactly four spaces.

5. Function length: Functions should be kept reasonably short and only perform a single logical operation.

6. Function structure: Functions should be structured in a way that's easy to read and understand, with clear separation between different sections of code.

7. Return values: Functions should clearly indicate what they return, and should only return values of the appropriate type.

8. Error handling: Functions should handle errors and exceptions in a consistent and appropriate way.

9. Global variables: Functions should avoid using or modifying global variables whenever possible.

10. Use of white space: Proper spacing and blank lines should be used throughout the function to improve readability and make the code easier to follow.

11. Comments: Comments should be used sparingly to explain complex sections of code or to describe the intent behind certain decisions.
