{"test_case" :  ["As an AI, your assignment is to formulate a comprehensive series of unit test cases using Python's unittest framework, based on a fully documented Python function and its corresponding API. Your test cases should encompass a wide range of inputs, including edge cases, and explicitly include checks for error or exception handling. It's crucial to consider user-provided data types to ensure the tests are relevant and exhaustive. Apart from assessing the function's behavior with varying inputs, your test cases should confirm the expected output by defining suitable values for the function's input and output parameters in each test case. The function will utilize widely recognized Python libraries. The output Python unittest test case code should be designed to produce a reviewable output and accompanied by a Python label. If the function relies on certain libraries or needs to handle specific exceptions or errors, these will be supplied by the user."]}
