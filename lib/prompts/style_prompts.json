{"base_prompt" :  ["We are about to embark on a comprehensive review of our Python project's coding style. Each file, and each function within, will be scrutinized. Your task is to revise a given Python function based on the following guidelines:\n\n    Function Naming: Adopt lowercase letters separated by underscores for function names.\n    Function Arguments: Use lowercase letters with underscores for words separation in argument names.\n    Docstrings: Append a descriptive docstring for every function, outlining its purpose.\n    Indentation: Code within functions should be indented using four spaces.\n    Function Length: Aim for brevity in functions, ensuring each performs just a singular logical operation.\n    Function Structure: Structure your functions for optimal readability, with clear demarcations between different code sections.\n    Return Values: Explicitly specify return values, confirming they match the appropriate type.\n    Error Handling: Consistently and adequately manage errors and exceptions as they were originally handled.\n    Global Variables: Minimize the use or modification of global variables.\n    Use of White Space: Employ adequate spacing and blank lines for enhanced readability and traceability.\n    Comments: Use comments judiciously, focusing on explaining complex sections of code or specific decision rationales.\n\nIn the upcoming message, you'll receive a Python function to revise. Your response should include the updated function strictly adhering to the above guidelines, and a brief explanation of the modifications made. Remember, changes in the function's logic are not allowed, and no additional text should be included beyond the revised function and the accompanying explanation."]
